Couldn't understand the bottom of the webpage. There is some sort of a author information but in a non-structured and not neat way. Removing that would be better. Mainly because you already have author information. -Yanki

            <p>must it involve the literal use of computers hardware and software?</p>
            <p>here in durham university, there are several aims for computational thinking as a module.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To introduce students to fundamental concepts from Computer Science and give students an appreciation of the breadth of Computer
                    Science and how different topics relate to one another.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To introduce students to the application of computational thinking in a range of settings across Computer Science
                </li>
                <li>
                    To give an awareness of the importance of computation and computational thinking in the modern world and the impact it has
                    on technology advances and areas not immediately associated with Computer Science.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>the ability to reason about the solution of general problems and apply different problem-solving techniques is
                one of the great contributions to society.</p>
            <p>
                by defining the situation at hand into a list of problems, it enables a systematic, targeted approach to derive a solution.
                it is about the constant the constant technological revamp, looking at previous solutions with a greater
                set of resources for increased effectiveness and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                as we travel further with the digital age, we see computational thinking far beyond computer science and engineering.

                music.
            </p>
            <p>
                computational thinking in daily life: pipeling, hashing, sorting.
            </p>
            <div class="ui small header">data analytics</div>
            <p>data analytics might not necessarily be the "best" contribution to society, but i am partial that it has contributed
                a fair bit.</p>
            <p>analysis of data has brought us so much for the everyday people. health diagnosis. weather predictions. personalized
                discounts.
            </p>
            <p>businesses benefit from knowing credit defaulters, sentiment analysis of their demographics.</p>
            <p>what would the
                <a class="special" href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Zola%27s_Algorithm">world</a>
                be like when prescriptive analytics becomes optimized for the layman?</p>
